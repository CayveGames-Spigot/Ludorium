- [ ] Entities not removed when overwritten by same name
- [ ] Solo cancel prompt has no audio
- [x] SE facing regions don't animate properly
- [ ] Overlap and same selection possible with different prompts
- [ ] Starter regions should be square? and consistent among other regions (will probably cause issues if not fixed)

- [ ] PlayerStateManager might cause an issue if the player has a base of less than 10 hearts (maybe other attributes too?)
